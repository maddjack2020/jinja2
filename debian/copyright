 -   String formatting is used even if no placeholders are used, which
 makes all strings use a consistent format. Remember to escape any
 raw percent signs as ``%%``, such as ``100%%``.
 -   The translated string is marked safe, formatting performs escaping
 as needed. Mark a parameter as ``|safe`` if it has already been
 escaped.
